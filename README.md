# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock
"Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock" is a game that allows the user to experience a truly random and more difficult version of the common in-person game "Rock, Paper, Scissors", often used to quicktly pass time or come to a decision about something. 

This version was popularized by the sit-com "The Big Bang Theory" and adds two new options to reduce the chances of ties and giving the players more fun correlations to remember.

This simple app will be targeted to a wide range of adults and children to enjoy and learn from.
